### To compile new template:

From within /public/js folder:
handlebars resources.handlebars -f template.js -k each -k if

### TODO:
x - Consider a url shortner for the really long links
  - Maybe not needed, just better, more generic names for the links.
x - Everything must have a Name, URL & Description or it's not ready
âˆš - Pre-compile Handlebars templates
x - Note direct downloads when they are the only thing available. (currently jXHR) 
x - What's the difference between code and download? Which do you want to provide a link to or both?
